Resident Evil 7 Autosplitter

After activating the RE7 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.
