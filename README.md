# re7
Instructions:

Eit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil 7". A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate". Next, click the "Settings" button and enable any splits you want. From there, you can rename the old splits to whatever you'd like.


After activating the RE7 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# I already used your old version, will my splits still work?

Yup. Disable "scriptable autosplitter" in your layout. From there, edit the old splits names to whatever you'd like.
